# Doca development conventions

For collaboration, editor SDK integration/upgrades, Yjs persistence, realtime selections or comment anchors, read and apply `skills/doca-collaboration/SKILL.md` and its linked contract before changing code. The same skill may be installed globally as `$doca-collaboration`.

The skill describes target invariants, not proof that a proposed API is implemented. Check the current package README/exports and compatibility before adapting. Keep `docs/collaboration-sdk-contract.md` as the source document and refresh the skill's packaged `references/contract.md` when it changes.

Do not run collaboration editing tests against user documents. Use isolated test databases/documents. Unrelated layout, calendar and visual styling tasks do not need the collaboration skill.

For editor package integration and cross-editor API work, also read `skills/doca-editor-integration/SKILL.md` and its integration reference. It distinguishes verified APIs from proposed capabilities; do not treat the target capability interface as already exported by a package.
